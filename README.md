# 📝 Text Mining Toolkit

## 📌 Overview
This project explores **text mining and Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques using Python.  
It demonstrates how to clean, preprocess, and analyze text data to extract valuable insights, such as word frequencies, sentiment, and topic structures.  

The repo is designed as a **learning resource** and a **reference toolkit** for common text mining workflows.
