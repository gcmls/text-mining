What happens to the gold in our safe ?	2
Natural to get cold feet .	6
Not very lucky , is he ?	5
I'm just a little anxious to get up there and whoop ET's ass , that's all .	1
Did you think we don't know about your affair with a government official ?	1
Next time you try that , I'll forget that you're a woman .	2
I said , [PERSON] , you're already married .	1
Maybe if I stuck him in a giant anthill , that would loosen his tongue and then ...	4
[PERSON] , he's been stripped .	2
Happy may have hit on something tremendous here .	5
Hey , [PERSON] .	2
Mine left me too .	6
You can just fucking die , you fuck .	1
I can take care of myself !	8
Let's go and see my cousin .	2
Well , it's our way of trying to understand .	1
Hephaestus will do what he can .	2
No , no , no , no , no .	1
Think I'm an idiot ?	1
To tell you the truth , [LOCATION] frightens me .	8
Look , it was great to see you again , okay ? I just --	5
Well , I'm feeling great .	5
Because I want to talk to you , face to face .	1
You're meaning ' the monster , ain't ya , mate ?	4
You changed that , and you can't change it back .	1
He was the technology .	6
Oh , that's delicious .	7
The helicopter has been hit !	4
We got the room booked for the whole morning .	2
Now I want you to tell me something .	2
You get out tomorrow !	2
At least you can't say the dinner isn't right .	2
You're better .	1
At the convention anything can happen .	2
I hit him too hard .	6
I got too messed up ' bro .	1
Look out below !	1
Old Yellowstain will be flattered .	6
Auryn will help you .	8
We march tonight .	2
I've got a headache , [PERSON] .	2
Now , be careful , children .	4
When neither of them made the cut ,	1
I do not even know who you are .	1
Alright , c'mon son , let's get movin' .	1
You are my last hope .	2
You can come out now , Red Eagle .	1
Do you think nobody can tell ?	1
The land down under ? That's a fabulous idea !	5
The committee wishes to emphasise that there is no evidence of any wider conspiracy .	1
I request a recess .	1
How many girls can we have for 100 , bucks ?	2
Now , this man is good .	8
It looks very nice on you .	5
It's all your fault .	6
I said he's retired !	1
If I had a Luger ...	1
It means you become their slave hours a day seven days a week .	2
[PERSON] ... ?	2
You mustn't be weak .	3
So what ?	7
Something funny happened this morning at the store .	7
They're doing the catering and making rather a horrid mess of it .	1
[PERSON] is a friend of mine .	8
He was completely misquoted .	8
Anything that man tells me will be a lie .	3
That is undoubtedly true .	8
The whole team is working on it , all right , and we will find her .	8
Hsiao - tsing ? !	1
Aren't you gonna tell me my sins are forgiven ?	2
That's not unusual .	7
I'll look after the horses .	1
I lost my place .	6
They really do know where I'm hiding , [PERSON] ?	7
We're together on that , aren't we ?	7
So , what do you want to study ?	2
Mommy , help me .	8
It's more than my job's worth !	1
They gonna be full up , from what I hear .	2
Why don't we have a drink for old time's sake ?	1
And what are you focused on now ?	1
No DNA found at the scene .	1
We've heard such wonderful things about you .	5
The heavyweight champion is down !	1
Do not worry .	8
I wouldn't want anybody to think I wasn't hospitable .	6
Maybe you should have let Mother make her own choice .	2
If you do that you'll get nothing , except maybe the police after you .	8
Vice President of the local Vagos .	8
I know something about the law ... and there's gonna be a law against you !	4
I guess .	6
I don't mind it if you call me [PERSON] , you know .	1
That thing is a killer !	3
Are you just about finished ?	1
You're my wife and I love you ... even if we don't get the baby .	1
Put up your hands !	1
Any trouble , call on the phone .	1
I don't want to put you to any trouble .	1
I want the truth now , no flannel .	1
He is very talented .	5
We've got to get out of here .	2
I could have you shot .	6
As a so called one percenter motorcycle club , [PERSON] are notoriously violent .	4
With her , it would be marriage or nothing , and that's out of the question .	1
Your mom wasn't ... well , and she needed time to recover , to get better .	1
This is a private conversation .	8
What else could I do ?	2
I didn't expect to see you , Mrs. [PERSON] .	7
Really ?	7
Are you really a singer ?	7
Give it a try .	1
We'll do all we can to help you .	8
No , no . - No interference from us , right ?	1
Now , you must fly out immediately !	1
You can't hold me without a warrant .	1
How ' bout it , handsome ?	2
You're becoming more beautiful every day .	5
I look great !	5
Oh , dear me .	5
I told you , he didn't even know I was going to do it .	1
What kind of personality ?	2
Good old honest Shooter .	8
Come in , God .	1
It's like they're after me , right ?	8
They told me you had a wine cellar , but I didn't believe it .	7
How about a homecoming dance for your old man ?	3
Don't bother your daddy now .	6
Yeah , we're just like clockwork .	2
You must have some idea where he was going .	1
No complaints .	1
I had a terrific time but I'm going home .	2
I sure hate to lose her for some reason or other .	1
I'll pay the ticket .	1
You can show me your tan .	2
I ... just afraid to lose you .	4
Bullshit ! What do you see ?	1
You give me no choice but to ground you .	1
Like staying here all night uninvited .	5
What then ?	7
Just like we're gonna find a big hunk of that long green .	2
Terrific !	2
Now is as good a time as any to learn .	2
Hey , hey , hey ! Where does it say	2
You got a badge and a gun but you're still a punk so shut up - - [PERSON] , please !	1
But after all , you're the logical man from the [LOCATION] for the national ticket .	8
And you agree ?	8
Well ?	1
He's hurt pretty bad .	6
Do not say to me that I have anything to live for .	1
I don't like being pushed around .	1
I expect you to take care of them .	8
I must have you .	1
This is quite a pleasant surprise .	7
The way you've ignored us , you wouldn't think so .	1
And I refuse to assist you in the rape of the [LOCATION] .	1
At the moment , you have an excellent chance of being hanged .	2
God , he is a tough old bird .	8
Hey , since when have you ever ?	5
Oh my God ! This is like romantical .	7
Unsatisfactory .	1
I'm just tired .	6
One more to go , chicken .	2
Take me to them , please .	4
But you look like you're more upset than that .	1
He's quite harmless .	8
You got the proof .	8
[PERSON] . [PERSON] ! It's finished .	2
You know how I loved her , really .	5
It's not all a lie , [PERSON] .	1
That means he's flying it .	7
There's still places I want to see and things I want to do .	2
I've come to get you - it's my party .	2
You know , come to think of it , It is a rather interesting conception .	2
No , those were rumours .	1
Get the fuck back !	1
I'm sorry , ma'am , but you're needed in the Situation Room .	6
Yes , I'll be with you in a minute , Mr. [PERSON] !	2
But if [PERSON]'s an angel , why ain't he in Heaven ?	4
Well , it's a shitty world .	5
I was dreadful .	6
Tell the cobbler I am delighted to have it .	5
You're still in love with her .	5
How are you , [PERSON] ? - Fine . This is a surprise .	7
You're not all together bad - lookin' .	6
I just hope there's no snakes round here .	2
I could cover you with kisses .	8
How are you ? - I'm OK .	2
I also love the King .	5
I know him through and through .	8
We'd have got married , had a house and children .	8
Sometimes I think there's almost a chance for us .	6
But it's The Neverending Story . I've already read it .	6
He's gone to .	6
What if he kills [PERSON] ?	4
He looks like a bronzed Apollo .	5
Is there something I can do for you ?	2
In the first place , this young lady is under exclusive contract to Mr. [PERSON] , of course , and he can not discuss her future availability at this time .	2
There's got ta be something else .	2
No , no , no . Shit .	1
I'm your brother [PERSON] .	8
Stop . Stop .	1
Okay , so all we need to do is get that message out , and ...	2
If I call you up in the middle of the night , tell you to come over and screw my old lady while I watch , what are you gonna do ?	1
Oh , is that what you told the general ?	7
Don't text me .	1
Oh , look at those eyes .	7
You must know how important that is to us .	8
Let me say the password .	1
If any of you have the time or interest , I would welcome your help .	2
I can hardly ever remember the audience being so excited .	5
Oh , [PERSON] .	7
You little bastard .	3
Look , money !	1
You OK ?	8
We were licked , weren't we ?	6
I'm not deciding for you .	1
In two years time , he's gonna make a run for it .	1
I wonder if there are any kites around here we can fly .	2
Don't tell me I did that !	1
Is murder a right reserved for that hated nation That has taken everything else from me ...	1
I'll be in the bar .	2
In here ! Quickly !	2
I thought you'd be thrilled to death .	7
Maybe you should have thought of that before you sent her to rob my client .	7
Come on , it's Christmas .	2
I'll step you around this town like you've never been stepped before .	1
You should rest .	8
I'd like to know how she feels about who should be held responsible .	2
Very well . I'll introduce them to you .	8
And we need to engage astronomers and amateur astronomers , and set up a sighting situation where we show them some evidence , and then show them how it's debunked .	2
In [LOCATION] ... I need a man able to impress them .	2
They might take us for innocent bystanders .	8
I've had 10 , years to get ready for this .	2
I hate this place .	1
I've been in the theatre . I'm actually a theatre director .	1
Well , this is more like it .	5
I can't sleep .	6
How did you know about that ?	7
I don't want to hear another word .	1
You know , for an Italian kid , you ain't got a bad butt .	8
They might have a hundred guns , but it's safer down here !	1
What are you jerking me around for ?	1
It's called urban blight .	1
I command it !	8
Could I get some extra mayo ?	2
I tried to enlist , they told them to me that I was too ancient .	6
People used to stop on the street to admire me .	1
I'm in love !	5
You've chosen the right agent , sir .	8
Do as I tell you !	8
You want to know the ... What do you call it ? Motivation ?	1
Poor girl .	6
I thought they said they was from [LOCATION] .	7
Away from all the words , the monuments , the whole rotten show .	1
The epidermal what ? No !	1
Be careful !	8
They got hard times as it is .	6
I spend time with them , yeah .	2
When we return , we're getting married .	2
Wait a minute . I don't understand .	1
I hear she comes real cheap .	2
That's me ! Junior !	1
They expect me to cut my finger off .	1
A man is going to die .	6
It's superficial .	1
My grandfather wouldn't have anything to do with him .	1
In the meantime , I'll be dead .	4
You sober right now ? Uh-huh . Eight months .	7
[PERSON] , are we going to make it to the island ?	2
I do .	8
What are you calling me [PERSON] for ?	1
I'll start weeping with self - pity any minute .	2
Could be .	2
So I'm just asking you ... to be with me .	1
They may come after the third car .	2
I didn't expect to be called to see the admiral , sir .	2
Why don't you shut the fuck up ?	1
We'll all squeeze in .	2
I like this man , I want him to know it .	8
Well , that was a personal matter .	1
Stay away from ...	1
Put your heads down . Put your fucking heads down !	1
[PERSON] , listen to me .	1
You can rot for all I care .	8
Sure . Use my box . I'm asking you to watch it with us .	8
All right , then .	8
All I can do is release you to make your own estimate of the situation .	1
Friends ?	8
You mean , you could sell us but you won't ?	1
If you need to take a break , you can .	1
You want me to talk with the Federal Bureau of Narcotics see if they have any problems ? Internal Revenue Service ?	1
that are years beyond what you could comprehend . 	7
There's no way to make this easy , [PERSON] .	1
Slow down , we lost [PERSON] !	6
I can't do this anymore .	6
And did you believe this nonsense ?	7
But with a nice sort of craziness .	5
She was the one ... who got you the passport to go to the [LOCATION] .	2
More mutilations !	8
We was safe there .	5
What should we name her ?	2
OK , so maybe I'll wise up someday too .	2
Well , sweetie , it's tomorrow .	2
You're mistaken if you think I'm leaving her here ... with a mother who doesn't consider her reputation .	1
He's the only senator to have .	8
♪ For me and you ♪	8
You think of me as sort of a cross between your wife and your mother .	1
How long are you staying in [LOCATION] , please , Mr [PERSON] ?	2
You know Mr. [PERSON] and Mr. [PERSON] from before ?	8
And you are the biggest liar of all !	1
Harry , what do you think would make [PERSON] happy ?	2
None of this departmental - loyalty crap .	1
What ? Thought I was gonna leave it to you ?	7
She's never cared for me .	1
Being right ain't gonna do us any good .	8
Produces beef , beer , shoes ... and good times .	5
I think we make a really good team . - We do .	8
Will you hold this drumstick ?	8
This boy's honest , not stupid .	1
I didn't know what to do .	7
Do you want to dance ?	2
When did that start ?	2
I wish it were anybody's child but yours !	6
Then come the physical proofs :	2
Did not it have to be resting ? Yes .	1
He's got all those .	8
Give him a good laugh .	5
I just went to sleep , woke up feeling fine , remembered everything .	5
Twenty minutes in rush hour isn't slight . Not when you're mayor of a major city !	1
See you tomorrow .	2
You sure ?	8
That is hardly for you to decide .	3
Come live with me And be my love	5
Which hedgehog ?	1
You've got to stop !	1
[PERSON] , may I come in ?	2
Fucking honey dripper .	1
I will give him an alibi and I shall be very convincing .	8
I guess everybody had given up hope , including the doctors .	4
You got ta be a real putz to wear a white coat around here .	1
If you are really brave and lucky , I can make you very , very rich .	5
I'm going to the zoo .	2
Any friends of mine are friends of his .	8
I hope I'm not obscure .	4
You wouldn't have come if you thought I was here .	7
She is my best friend .	8
Storm the bastille !	1
Let me know if you see anything , huh ?	2
How could they with you here ?	7
The island's ours ?	5
It wasn't about the money , it was just about the anger .	6
Leave us alone .	4
Here is one of the greatest attractions you'll ever see in your born days !	5
Good luck .	8
Awesome . This is rad .	2
Look at that shit .	1
Boy , you amaze me .	8
There's no reason for anyone to come after me .	8
Okay , that didn't help at all .	6
[PERSON] , I can't make it so soon ...	2
When I first took a deal to become an undercover informant in a biker gang , I did it to save my own skin. ,	1
She's quite right . I'll look after them for you .	8
I'm going to join up with our brave lads in gray .	2
They may do a better job of it than we have .	8
One look from the head of [LOCATION] can turn all creatures into stone .	1
No , I'm serious .	4
Seems much slower than the other eight times I've seen it .	6
What is it , [PERSON] ?	7
You know , I'm thinking of training you for cashier . Really ?	8
You call this a tip , you cheap bastard ? !	3
Don't think for a minute That was an empty threat he made .	1
We're really gonna have a great time .	2
Will you go to the medical officer with me and repeat what you've said ?	1
[PERSON] , we have to go downstairs quickly !	2
After months of combat , it takes hours a day to keep her together .	8
This one is getting too popular .	1
I am sorry .	6
Fantastic , isn't it ?	5
You know I don't understand that shit .	1
Tell [PERSON] to wait in the shop for me .	2
I'll tear it out of the calendar .	1
I can't tell you that !	1
And when it comes time for her to marry ... well , she'll be a little princess .	2
And now , he wants to buy me ?	1
What's Zharkov doing on the plane ?	1
We'll make it to [LOCATION] if you're not careful !	8
Calm down !	1
I can't go to the grand jury without him .	1
Do not do this to me , [PERSON] .	1
God , what's our status ?	7
You're a one - man disaster area .	8
Why , [PERSON] , you aren't supposed to know anything about that .	7
Fine - looking couple , [PERSON] .	5
Oh , now , Mammy , be reasonable .	4
Have multiple targets sighted .	6
Judge , you said we would be entitled to some leeway ...	8
Come on , Dad .	2
I can't do this .	1
We haven't anything to discuss with you .	8
Yeah . - More than anything else in the world ?	1
It's only temporary , you know ?	8
Stop !	1
Sit down !	1
CinCPac wants it all to arrive on time and intact .	2
I mean , jeez ...	1
Leave me alone !	1
Thanks , Dad .	2
Send somebody for the militia .	1
You're not beginning that again , are you ?	1
Every living being is capable of attack ... if sufficiently provoked .	1
Yeah , he's right , we got to keep moving , [PERSON] .	8
It may bring you serious trouble .	4
Oh , this is so cool !	5
Let me talk to her again .	1
Why should I give a crap ?	1
Who bow and smile and scrape and spend their nights gnawing the chairs and floors out from under us all .	1
Okay ? - We're not dead yet ?	4
I don't say that with any kind of blame or accusation , but that is when it started .	6
Did you really think he would come with you ?	1
I've never felt more alive in my whole life .	6
What ? Get off my coat !	1
The question is what are you doing here ?	7
Perhaps that's why I'm incapable of having a child .	1
Cody , wait !	2
It is well .	8
If that horse would run tomorrow ,	2
There's my favourite little boy .	5
I'm trying to clean up the party . Our party . And I end up speaking out of turn .	1
So alone .	6
And don't try anything funny , cos you know what you'll get .	2
He says it's dangerous to spend the night in the village .	1
Everything's so clean . Everybody's so nice .	5
He was trying to stop it .	1
I think I've finally found a sport I like .	5
Somebody will listen to me .	1
My mommy hurt my head .  	4
Has decided to demolish ...	1
You look so cool !	5
My very best friends .	8
Give a girl a chance to breathe .	2
They're armed .	1
And it's a miracle old [PERSON]'s alive today .	7
Stole my Tintoretto . and my [PERSON] . And it has taken all [PERSON]'s bronze [LOCATION] the Countess .	3
I could have saved time and liquor by doing this in my office , but it needs a little ceremony .	2
It's dangerous jouncing Mrs. [PERSON] over open country .	4
My unit's due to be shipped out soon .	2
In which case , you'd be throwing out decades of disarmament progress .	1
Prisoner has a right to escape , hasn't he ?	4
Don't worry , kid !	4
You know ... Sometimes I even amaze myself .	8
I'd give my soul to go , but I can't .	1
You're not just a crook , but a murderer .	1
He's still emotionally unstable .	2
I'm sure you'll need them if you're gonna go into rats in detail .	8
You shut up , Dude , and listen to me .	1
Right there ... in those big blue eyes .	1
That's right .	8
Morphine syrette . Give me a morphine syrette . I got it .	1
I broke my glasses .	1
Welcome to [LOCATION] , ma'am .	2
You're nuts !	3
Myself . When I am in possession of my faculties and [PERSON] is not .	6
It made a thief of [PERSON] , a pig out of [PERSON] and a fool of you .	1
Well , it should be a pretty smooth flight . The weather's clear to [LOCATION] .	2
Your famous [PERSON] is safe .	8
You are dead inside .	4
Am I sure ?	8
I am the avenger .	1
No , no , no , I don't mean that .	1
It hurts me when people laugh at you .	6
But I had locked the briefcase of the [PERSON] in the morning following to her death .	6
I can't seem to keep you two out of the hospital lately .	6
I do not like Mr. [PERSON] .	1
I killed this person for their money , right ?	4
Thank you , Mr. [PERSON] .	8
Cheese doodles !	1
Maybe we'll get lucky .	2
They're here .	1
He never even heard of [PERSON] .	1
I rehearse my story . I try to think of all the questions they'll ask .	2
Hey , you know me .	8
Before proceeding further , I'll remind the visitors in the gallery that they are here as our guests and should conduct themselves as such .	2
What's the idea of turning her down ?	1
Well , now , there's a lovable chap .	2
Let me out , or I'll kill myself .	4
We're realists , knowing that we're on the outside looking in . - We calmly accept our uncertain position . - Yeah .	8
I killed her ! I killed her like she was an animal .	4
At my age , corrected by an illiterate .	5
There's some hot biscuits in the warmer .	2
[PERSON] , what the hell have you done to the coffee ?	1
The clerk will call the roll .	2
I'm getting darned sick of the way she's acting .	3
You do not deny , then , that such a monster could exist . Is that correct ?	1
If I was you , I would go home and talk to your family people .	1
Interesting problem we got on this one :	2
Their privilege , their presumption .	1
Think I'm a fool ?	3
m glad for you . 	5
[PERSON]'s looking for a new assistant and wants to meet you for a drink .	2
Oh , you little beauty !	5
[PERSON] , don't try it .	1
We got ta stick together , cos what are we ?	8
By the way ...	1
What'd he die of ?	4
She got what she deserves .	2
Yes ? What is it ?	2
She seemed too restless , too tense , too withdrawn , and [PERSON] , when he wasn't looking at [PERSON] , he was watching [LOCATION] look at Maria .	6
Just get out of my house .	1
He attacked your bitch .	1
Emergency speed , all engines !	7
Ready to celebrate ?	2
I know what you're going to say .	1
However , just at the moment , I have drinking to do .	2
It's not that easy to kill someone and get away with it .	1
I'm glad for the company .	5
It's yours , I want you to have it . It's for you .	2
It's Nobel Prize juice . Set sail for home , for [LOCATION] !	2
I've got some job possibilities for you .	8
I'll get some help !	8
Are you trying to kill me ?	4
It stung at first , but now I can't feel a thing .	6
I'll ... bet the size of the pot .	2
We're that kind of monster .	4
I'm going home . I - I'm not well .	1
It's funny , she didn't mention a husband .	7
Champagne !	5
Don't you get it ?	1
When does it leave ?	1
I did it , bro .	7
Aren't you human ?	7
She's alright . She's better than before .	1
That's how it looks in my report unless you've got something to change it .	2
What bothers you ?	1
Stop fidgeting .	1
Mayii : I had long since lost track Of the child [PERSON] .	6
Thank you for using ATT .	8
I wanted to look mellow and I look brittle .	2
Bye , Commander .	5
They're not putting up the money .	1
Oh , your parents should be ashamed of themselves	3
Well , that's the problem . Um ... The bad guys took it .	1
You'll meet him shortly .	2
Frank . The Benzedrine's got my teeth wiggling .	8
Don't look at me .	1
Is that so far from your desire ?	7
[PERSON] dam is a fraud .	8
Ghosts ?	4
I'm broke .	1
[LOCATION] has done the impossible .	1
I know how this city degrades the individual .	2
Now let him win it back !	2
It's gonna be awkward , but this kid comes first .	2
The State calls Detective [PERSON] .	1
I order all ghosts to be expelled !	1
I see that it's funny .	5
Are you off your trolley ?	1
Tonight , we go and make party .	2
I'm having friends in on Wednesday for dinner and drinks .	8
I just hose them off , if she gets on them .	1
You want to work for somebody else ? - No .	1
Actually , we wanted to do some remodeling first .	2
Please sit down , sober up .	1
He can't be your friend .	8
Now , look . You're a vaguely amusing and not unattractive guy , but I'm not even remotely interested .	1
Shoot it !	1
You look like death .	3
The devil is always waiting in the shadows .  	1
Get the legs .	1
Very well .	8
Do you drink this stuff ? No .	3
Or a liar .	1
You know , for a minute , that [PERSON] almost had me convinced I was wrong .	1
We come from a good family My name is Windy	8
I think that about covers it for now .	1
Don't lose no sweat , Kid .	1
Who's afraid of a little booger ?	4
Because I watched [PERSON] go through exactly what you're going through right now .	1
You just wait .	2
I went off because I gained like six pounds ,	5
I have improved it .	1
We're fools to tolerate it .	3
Are you confessing to this ?	8

You're not going to hang me ?	1
You may have overlooked the fact that the use of officers for labour is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention .	8
If that's what the grown - ups have done with this world , we have to start those boys ' camps and see what the kids can do .	1

Nice questions you ask .	1
I'd say you were the only man I ever loved .	5
It had to be filled with love .	5
How much simpler it would be , for so many of us , if [PERSON] had not found it necessary to look for a new face .	4
There were some problems with ...	4
Do you mean he'd never seen a clock before ?	7
You couldn't leave your girl ?	6
This time it is you who does not understand . I know [PERSON] better than you do .	1
Rushing home to a hot apartment to listen to the automatic laundry and the electric dishwasher and the garbage disposal and the nagging wife .	1
That dated us , all right , but it gave us something to do .	2
Crazy out of your skull .	1
Die , you bastard !	3
I didn't jump .	6
The point is of no return ... and you've reached it !	1
