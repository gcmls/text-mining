# 📝 Text Mining Toolkit

Turn raw text into insights with NLP and visualization.

---

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates how to apply **text mining and Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to extract knowledge from unstructured text.  

It includes a complete workflow:
1. **Data collection & preprocessing** → cleaning text, tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization.  
2. **Exploratory analysis** → frequency distributions, n-grams, TF-IDF.  
3. **Visualization** → word clouds, sentiment heatmaps, bar plots.  
4. **Modeling** (optional) → topic modeling (LDA) and sentiment classification.  

This toolkit is designed for **learning, experimentation, and as a starting point** for real-world NLP projects.
